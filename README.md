# Obstacle Detection

In this project, I used an ESP32 microcontroller and an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to detect if there is an obstacle approaching a car. The system is notified if an obstacle is within a particular distance from the sensor, with the help of a message on the TFT display of the microcontroller.
